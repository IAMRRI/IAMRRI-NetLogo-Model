# Step 1. Create a Repository

A GitHub repository for IAMRRI project has been created, and we have firstly included a README file, with information about project.

The IAMRRI repository, will be a place where we will store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others about IAMRRI.

- This repository will be used to organize the project programing activities of WP3 & WP5.

- It will be also used to the project managing of WP5, that is leaded by GZE.

- It will contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything our projects will need.
